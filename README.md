**Project Title:** Power Grid System

**Project Description:**
The Power Grid System project involves storing data of connected houses with different propagators using Python programs with the assistance of graph data structures. The objective is to utilize graph data structures and perform operations such as addition and removal of houses and propagators from the designed structure. The implementation employs a dictionary as an adjacency list to store the graph data. The project simulates a power grid system for electricity distribution to houses connected with various propagators. Each power grid consists of propagators responsible for supplying power to different areas and houses. 

Key Features:
- Implementation of a graph data structure to represent the power grid system.
- Addition and removal of houses and propagators from the graph structure.
- Proper management of power distribution based on propagator capacities and house demands.
- Utilization of directed edges with weights to represent power supply connections between propagators and houses.
- Ensuring local stability of propagators and adherence to capacity limitations.
- All propagators are interconnected, facilitating efficient power distribution within the grid system.
